# CTF_and_Other_Challenge_Write_Ups

All write ups are done by Ajay, without any assistance. This is also to how much I have practiced over the years.

Notes:
	I have lost a few write ups somewhere on my computers, so I have to look for them later....
	There are a few challenges that I never wrote a write up for either cause I couldnt or didnt get a chance to write one up cause human error.
